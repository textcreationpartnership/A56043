            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Land wherein I was born, and love and pity above all the Kingdoms upon the Face of the Earth, because of the Lord's Appearances by his Light and Power in thee, above all other Lands in these last days: But most of you the Inhabitants of this Land have slighted and vilified God's Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to you, and the pure and heavenly Manifestation of his Light &amp; Power in and amongst you; wherefore Darkness is over you, and your Seers Eyes are closed through their Rebellion against the Light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel, which has shined both in their and your Hearts, to give you the Light of the Knowledge of God in the Face of Christ Jesus, and to open your blind Eyes, to recover your Sight, that ye might see your Evil Ways that ye have walked in, and those great Abominations that ye have committed in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62917:3"/> Land; for which Distress, Wo and Misery hath come upon the Inhabitan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And how are the People of <hi>England</hi> laden with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity?</hi> How have <hi>many of you</hi> let your Reins loose to all manner of <hi>Sins!</hi> What <hi>Cryes of Oppression and Cruelties</hi> have been heard, and are now heard in our Land, acted by them that profess <hi>Christ Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O Friends! its not the <hi>Renting of your Garments,</hi> but <hi>y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur Hearts,</hi> that God requires; for ye have appeared something in shew of Religion, whilst your Hearts have been far from God. Truly, my Bowels are turn'd for <hi>You;</hi> I am full of Sorrow and Grief for my <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that have so abused the <hi>loving-kindness</hi> of a <hi>long-suffering God, who is slow to Wrath,</hi> neither shews he his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62917:3"/> Wrath till his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Long-suffering</hi> be abused by a sinful Nation, or People laden with Iniquity, &amp; guilty of manifold Transgressions. O! consider; is not this the state of <hi>many of you?</hi> have ye not followed a Multitude to do Evil, and the Wayes and Devices of your own Hearts? are ye not unsensible of the Day of God's tender Visitation to you wards, and of his pure Light that shines in your dark Hearts?</p>
            <p>And all you Evil doers every where, you hate the Light, and love Darkness rather than Light, that will be your Condemnation, <hi>That Christ Jesus is come a Light into the World;</hi> and if ever you come to be the Children of God and his Light▪ you must turn to his Light, wait and believe in it; for those that do not, remain in utter Darkness, not knowing whither they go, they are so <hi>uncertainly led by the Blind Guides of this World.</hi> This hath been and is certainly the State of <hi>many of you,</hi> the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> How have ye been led by the blind Leaders of the Blind into the Ditch, and kept in the fall of old <hi>Adam▪</hi> neither having seen or known what ye have been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the <hi>By Pathes</hi> and <hi>Crooked Wayes</hi> you have walked in! and how hath <hi>every man of you</hi> walked in a Vain Shew, and disquieted <hi>your selves</hi> in vain, in getting the <hi>Worldly Riches,</hi> but cannot tell who must enjoy them after you, nor whether <hi>you may enjoy them</hi> while ye are here in the World!</p>
            <p>Therefore hear ye the Word of the Lord; O! hearken diligently that your Souls may live, and be saved in this Day of the Lord Jesus, <hi>who is come to seek and to save them that are lost, who is willing to bring and lead you all out of the Fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>which was by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62917:4"/> Sin and Transgression;</hi> for <hi>he is the Saviour of the World, not coming to condemn the World, but that the World through him might believe and obtain Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O People! look unto Him, and not to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Hills for Salvation, as long you have done, but all in vain; for, what Profit have ye had in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Man, or the Mountains or Hills, when you were in Trouble and Distress? who could help or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, save the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> only?</p>

            <p>So People, In the Name of the Eternal God I warn
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62917:4"/> and exhort you all to Arise, arise, and stand up from the Dead, and Dust of the Earth, and Graves of Sin and Iniquity, where you have lain long, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an Everlasting Rest in; <hi>for this is not your Rest, it is poluted,</hi> and hath poluted you. O! come to Christ Jesus, who is that quickening Spirit, that is able to quicken you, and make you alive to God, and make you all Partakers of a true and living Hope and Faith to purge your Hearts and Consciences by, to purifie you, and make you Vessels of his Honour, who have been and are Vessels of Dishonour, in which state you are very unfit for the Lord's Use, how fit soever you have been and may be for the Devil's Use▪ as his Slaves and Vassels, and led captive by him at his Will, who hath taught you to say to your Souls, <hi>Take your Rest in that which is Poluted, and in your great stores of Goods, which some have gotten▪ and laid up for many years;</hi> not considering how shortly your Souls may be required of you, nor whose these things shall be then: for so hath the Devil, the Enemy of your Immortal Souls, besotted and benumbed many of you in this day, and kept you in Sin and Trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, dead, unawakened to Righteousness, Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life and Salvation. Verily I cannot but pity your sad state that you are in, and lament for you, and pray you in Christ's stead, to come out of it, to Him who desires not the Death of the Wicked, but rather that all such would turn from their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and live a Holy, Righteous and Godly Life in this present World.</p>
            <p>O ye People of <hi>England!</hi> how hath the Spirit of the Lord striven with you, and the Lord stretched forth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62917:5"/> his Hand all the day long, notwithstanding your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and your hardning of your Hearts against him? How hath the Lord waited to be good and gracious to this Land, and the Inhabitants thereof? How many Pledges of his Love and Favour towards it hath been given unto it, and scarce sooner given, but the Hearts of most people of this Nation have been lifted up within them, and the Lord hath been forgotten, who extended his Love and Favour uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, to leave all without excuse at his great Day of Judgment, when he will appear in Flames of Fire to render Vengeance against them that know him not▪ nor obey the Gospel, which was to be preached to every Creature▪ that all might believe in Christ Jesus, and know his Baptism, that saves, therewith to be baptized, who thereby washes the inside of Man and Woman, and not the outside only, as the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> did the Cup and Platter. And let none talk of being saved and justified by Christ, who are not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by him, and baptized by one Spirit into that Body whereof Christ Jesus is Head; for they that are not so baptized and washed, are not living Members of the Body of Christ, but Members of, and Plead<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers for the Body of Death and Darkness, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Body of Sin and Iniquity about with them till they come at their Graves, so are altogether kept uncapable of putting on the new Man, because they see not the Way how to put off the old Man with his Deeds▪ which certainly is the woful state of many of you▪ who are Inhabitants of this Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> What will it avail you to plead, <hi>that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ Jesus, and are baptized into the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62917:5"/> Faith,</hi> whilst you are not come to know a passing from Death to Life, and whilst your Hearts are evil, defiled with sin, and not purified? will not your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief be accounted of God and his Spirit for Unbelief, and your Faith a dead one, by which ye can never please Him, even God, or the Lord Jesus Christ, whom ye pretend to believe in, but are not come to witness him in you the Hope of Glory; you are to come to know him in you, to work in you by his mighty Power, else you are Reprobates: And if Christ be known in you, the Body of Sin you will come to leave and put off; then will ye put off the Old Man with his Deeds, and dye daily to Sin, which is the Devil's Work, and that Work Christ came and comes to destroy: He dyed not that people should continue in sin, and in the great Abuse of his Goodness and Kindness towards them, but that they might prize his Love, Goodness and Kindness towards Mankind in general, in coming to save them from sin, to finish Transgression, and to put an end to Sin, and bring in Everlasting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which hath been so shut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I can truly say, that I never loved the Principles nor Practices of the <hi>Papists,</hi> being certainly hurtful, and Inconsistent with the Peace and Quiet of the Land where they live, and under those Governments and Rule that are set over; I am for Good and Peaceable Principles, that induce people to live a Quiet and Peaceable Life; for those Principles are Hellish and Unchristian, that lead people to <hi>Stab, Murder</hi> and <hi>Massacree</hi> such as differ from them, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forsake their own Religion, which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded is good, and embrace such a Religion as they know is not good, neither tending to the Honour of God, but to introduce Badness, with pernicious Ways and evil Contrivances, thereby to rob God of that Honour which is due to him alone.

            <p>O the great <hi>Thunders, Earthquakes</hi> and <hi>Tempests</hi> that are come &amp; coming upon this Nation &amp; many others!

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62917:15"/> them that sit in Darkness, and under the Region of the shadow of Death.
